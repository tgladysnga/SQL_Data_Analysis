# SQL Data Analysis
The dataset contains data from startups that develop new apps for book lovers. We've been given a database of one of the services competing in the market to analyze in order to make decisions on a profitable new inclusion.

# Goal
For this project, we are to connect to a Postgresql database in order to run SQL queries on the following data from a startup: books, publishers, authors, and customer ratings and reviews of books.
The resulting analysis will be used to generate a value proposition for a new product.
